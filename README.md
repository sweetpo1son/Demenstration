# Demenstration
Python codes include preliminary models for multi-step time series forcasting (crude oil price) and hyper-parameters optimisation scripts. Most of the models are based on neural network. The codes were designed as scripts to run on Kaggle. 

MATLAB codes are for one of the CATAM computing projects, 'Random Binary Expansion', based on the Monte Carlo method.
